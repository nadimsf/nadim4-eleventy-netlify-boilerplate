I am a product management leader currently at Uber, where I've worked on simulation, visualization and ML platforms for autonomy software development for self-driving cars, as well as growth and ad tech. Prior to that I was ceo and cofounder of BrightFunnel, a data and analytics platform for b2b marketers, which was acquired after scaling to $5M in ARR and 50 employees. I have previously worked at Salesforce, Amazon and McAfee, as well as startups. I have 15+ years of experience in SaaS at with the last 8 years focused on data and AI.
